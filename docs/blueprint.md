## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and knowledge. This vibrant primary ensures readability and visual appeal against the lighter background.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F0F4F8), nearly white to ensure maximum readability and a modern, clean aesthetic.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800). This analogous color draws attention to important elements and actions without overwhelming the user interface. It complements the primary blue, creating a balanced and inviting look.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines. Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. The combination offers clarity, modern feel, and readability.
- Use a consistent set of modern, minimalist icons throughout the app to represent different actions and content categories.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy, prioritizing key information and actions. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter and enhance readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading spinners, hover effects, and confirmation messages.
